This is the documentation for `text_dedup` â€” a collection of Python scripts for text deduplication. Each script maintains a unified command line interface that takes in a huggingface dataset and produces a deduplicated version of it. Some scripts are designed to handle large datasets and should be run on a cluster. Others are designed to be run on a single machine for small to medium sized datasets.
